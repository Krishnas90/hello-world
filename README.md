Hello World Project: My very first step into the world of front-end web development! This repository features a simple 'Hello World' webpage created using HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript. It's a foundational project as I begin my journey to mastering web development. Follow along as I continue to learn and build more complex projects!
